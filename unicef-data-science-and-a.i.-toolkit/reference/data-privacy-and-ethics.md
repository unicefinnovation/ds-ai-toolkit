# Data Privacy & Ethics

Data science is an extremely powerful discipline, but that power can cause harm especially to marginalised groups. Often these harms are not immediately visible when incorporated into AI modeling or more complex down stream processes. For this reason, the ethical and data privacy implications of your proposed workplan will be scrutinised in detail as part of your application to the Venture fund. Many of these implications will be covered by the [Data Privacy & Security](https://app.gitbook.com/o/dzsBDD9SiWXEEyjPOOwx/s/8TvioEC2HyvZZAGDhtfR/) and [Product Design](https://app.gitbook.com/o/dzsBDD9SiWXEEyjPOOwx/s/yz1WKISRzccLblgdJi7L/) mentoring processes. However it might be useful to consult [_How do I evaluate a machine learning model to ensure fairness?_](../quick-answers-to-questions.md#how-should-i-evaluate-a-machine-learning-model-to-ensure-fairness)&#x20;

There are a number of resources that address the ethical use of AI both from a hard legal standpoint and in an advisory sense. You might want to consult the most appropriate for you jurisdiction.

For example, the [UK government playbook on AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government/artificial-intelligence-playbook-for-the-uk-government-html) lists the following dimensions

* safety, security and robustness
* transparency and explainability
* fairness, bias and discrimination
* accountability and responsibility
* contestability and redress
* societal wellbeing and public good

UNICEF has adopted an [ethical AI framework](https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/reports/policy-guidance-ai-children) based on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Much of this describes how to centre children in the design of AI systems

1. Support children’s development and well-being
2. Ensure inclusion of and for children
3. Prioritize fairness and non-discrimination for children
4. Protect children’s data and privacy
5. Ensure safety for children
6. Provide transparency, explainability, and accountability for children
7. Empower governments and businesses with knowledge of AI and children’s rights&#x20;
8. Prepare children for present and future developments in AI
9. Create an enabling environment
