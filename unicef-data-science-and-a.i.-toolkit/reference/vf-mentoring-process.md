# VF Mentoring process

The mentoring process for VF funded companies will look different for each company depending on how central DS is to their solution, at what stage the company is at and other factors. But in general the mentoring process considers the following pillars while also making sure to hit each milestone in the quarterly workplan.

1. Scoping: what is the problem to be solved? Who are the users? What data will you use  and how will it be collected? What kind of modeling would you like to do?
2. Data: What are the data sources? If the data is open, is it frequent/reliable enough? Is it open? What is the schema of the data and how do they relate through a data map? What does the data look like?
3. Modeling: What is the baseline for your model performance? How will you measure performance? What will your experimentation process look like and how will you track it?
4. Deployment: How will your model be deployed and rolled out? How will you measure the performance? How will you measure and fix any drift?
