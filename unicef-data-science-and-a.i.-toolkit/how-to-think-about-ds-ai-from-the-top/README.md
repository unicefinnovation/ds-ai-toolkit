# How to think about DS/AI from the top

Nearly all organisations are data science companies, in some way. _Data science_ is about taking data in a raw form and taking some steps to transform or combine that data in order to provide some value or insight to a user. This might mean using the data in an AI model.&#x20;

The 'science' part means that what you do should be scientific; it should be tested and documented carefully and it should be reproducible etc. However, data science is not science in the sense that there isn't always one single 'correct' solution. Often there are many possible solutions that are good enough.
