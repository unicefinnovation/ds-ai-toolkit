## What if we don’t have the right data to solve the problem?

This has to do with inherent limitations that may exist in the information collected. At some point, no technology or analysis will help you further. Considering whether the right data exists is critical at the early project stage. You may want to create contingencies to pivot towards collecting better data to answer the question. Or, if the data simply does not exist or is impractical to collect, revert to the original question of interest and redefine the project scope. This is about aligning expectations and gets to why the project was initiated in the first place.

## What if we don’t like the results?

This is when the results of the project are not those anticipated by the end user. This can be a function of not having the right data, poor model inputs or poor model predictions in specific scenarios. The possibility that the project might lead to poor results should be discussed among the project stakeholders. This addresses differences in how individuals might accept the results of the project and reveal inherent biases individuals might have. This avoids initiating a project where you already know there’s only one acceptable result. &#x20;

## When is the project over?

This is about aligning expectations and gets to why the project was initiated in the first place. Think about what the final deliverable is and work iteratively backward. Gather stakeholder input and identify reasons the project could end. Setting aside obvious failures, such as lack of funding or losing interest, focus should be on the needs to be delivered and how to conclude the project. Many projects will require ongoing support and maintenance, but this should be clarified up front. The answer to when the project is over shouldn’t be assumed, until asked.
